On this page, we will share with you many deep insights into open source databases, such as the database popularity, database contributors, coding vitality, community feedback and so on. 

Weâ€™ll also share the SQL commands that generate all these analytical results above each chart, so you can use them on your own on TiDB Cloud following this [10-minute tutorial](/blog/try-it-yourself/).
