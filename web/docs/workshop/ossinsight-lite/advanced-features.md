1. For public repositories, leave all the scopes unchecked (you only need basic read access). If you want to sync data from your private repositories as well, check the "repo" scope.
2. Click Generate token at the bottom of the page.
3. Make sure to copy the generated token as you won't be able to see it again. Save it securely, as you will need it later.
